    <p>Knowledge exists potentially in the human soul like the seed in the soil; by learning the potential becomes actual. ' Abu Hamid al-Ghazali
        The purpose of education is to develop the whole person â€“ heart, soul and intelligence, for serving the common good by seeking knowledge and acquiring virtues. And this purpose can be achieved only when the process of learning is infused with a spiritual dynamic and moral compass.
        The Coordination of Islamic Colleges (CIC) embodies this holistic vision of knowledge.
        As a multi-layered educational governing body, CIC strives to restore the harmony among the multiple paradigms of knowledge and wisdom: the sacred and the secular; the revelatory and the empirical; the spiritual and the temporal etc.
        The greatest enemy of real knowledge is not ignorance but the illusion of knowing. Dogmas of truth, be it scientific or religious, can only be mutually exclusive and antipathetic. But serving as cross-fertilizing knowledge-systems they can become complementary and harmonized.
        The CIC seeks to achieve this by blending the principles of faith, vision and creativity. The courses designed and implemented by CIC aim to mould morally committed professionals, intellectuals and spiritual leaders who are grounded in the Islamic scholarly tradition and conversant with the scientific, cultural, political, and intellectual currents that are shaping the modern society.</p>
